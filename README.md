This project presents a simple web UI to test a collection of log line samples against a pattern
supported by the [Filebeat dissect processor](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/master/dissect.html).

> Both [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-filters-dissect.html) and
> [Elasticsearch pipelines](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/dissect-processor.html)
> have a similar filter/processor that uses the same configuration pattern. Therefore, this UI can be
> used to test a pattern that will be used in either Logstash or Elasticsearch pipelines.

## 🎮 Installing / Getting started

```shell
docker run --rm -ti -p 8080:8080 jorgelbg/dissect-tester
```
